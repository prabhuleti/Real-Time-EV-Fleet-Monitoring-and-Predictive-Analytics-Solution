## Features  
### 1. **EV Registration and Monitoring**  
- **Vehicle Registration**: Register and store EV details in the database.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track key metrics like speed, location, and battery status in real time.

### 2. **Battery Health Status**  
- Monitor battery performance.  
- Generate alerts for low battery or performance degradation.  
- Optimize routes based on battery levels and nearby charging stations.

### 3. **Driver Behavior Analysis**  
- Analyze driver behavior based on acceleration, braking, and speed patterns.  
- Identify areas for improvement to ensure safety and fuel efficiency.

### 4. **Maintenance Alerts**  
- Predict and schedule maintenance using predefined rules.  
- Receive alerts for potential vehicle issues.

### 5. **Cost and Energy Consumption Analysis**  
- Visualize energy consumption trends.  
- Monitor fleet operating costs for optimization opportunities.

### 6. **Report Generation**  
- Generate customizable reports for performance, cost, and energy usage.  
- Export reports in multiple formats for sharing and analysis.
